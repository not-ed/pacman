This repository contains the project files and code for Pacman, a clone of the original arcade game which was written for a first-year assignment at Staffordshire University.

# About
This project is a Pacman clone written using C++ and S2D, a bespoke library provided by Staffordshire University which is derived from [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) and included within this repository. On top of containing the usual feature set one might expect, the game also features level switching, local high scores between sessions, and a basic implementation of an event system for handling object-to-object interaction, among other things.

This project also acts as a personal milestone, being the first game project completed without the use of a proprietary engine such as Unity or Unreal Engine.

# Requirements
This repository contains the complete Visual Studio solution and project files, along with all required dependencies already. **This includes the S2D library!** - Simply pull the repo and open the project.
